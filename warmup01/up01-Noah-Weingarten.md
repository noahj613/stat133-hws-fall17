2) Quadratic Formula
--------------------

### General Form: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

In Algebra, a quadratic equation is said to have the form: *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

where *x* represents an unknown, and *a, b,* and *c* represent known numbers such that *a* is not = 0

The quadratic formula can be used to find the root(s) of a quadratic equation.
